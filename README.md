# VICON2023

Welcome to ```FJ005``` flying arena for your experiments! We all know that experiments play an important role for your research/capstone projects, and we are here to help! 

Note that this repo serves as a quick guidance/cheatsheet for y'all to maneuver through computers, connections and all that sorta stuff, yet it is not meant to be a comprehensive explaination on how things work. So! Please do make sure that you have the fundementals before you step into the arena.

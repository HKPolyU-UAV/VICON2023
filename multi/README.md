# Multi machine on ROS 

1. **Setup bash**
    
    Copy the multi.sh to both your ```ROS_MASTER-``` and ```ROS_SLAVE-``` machine.
2. **Source**

    At each terminal launch (both MASTER and SLAVE), run the shell file in order to make all ```ROS_NODEs``` on all machine to interact with the same ```ROS_MASTER```.
